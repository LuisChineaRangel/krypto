## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

- `kypto_lib/`: Core library code for cryptographic operations.
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for the library.
- `cli/`: Command-line interface tools for interacting with the library.
- `api/`: RESTful API endpoints for remote cryptographic services.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.
- `pyproject.toml`: Project metadata and configuration.

Each module is designed to be independent, allowing for easy maintenance and future expansion.
